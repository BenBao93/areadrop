# areadrop
Simple class to create area chart like images with PHP. Potential use cases are for example backdrops on stock info cards.

Custom sizes and colors are supported and images can be sent direct to the browser or stored on the local file system, which requires writing rights on the folder.

Usage is documented in the examples.php code.
